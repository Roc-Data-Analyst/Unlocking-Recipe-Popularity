# Unlocking Recipe Popularity: Data-Driven Insights and Models for High-Traffic Recipe Recommendations
Welcome to my journey through the captivating realms of machine learning and data analytics! üöÄ In this repository, I unveil the secrets behind predicting recipe popularity using the power of data-driven insights.

## Explore the Data
1. **Data Validation & Cleaning:** I meticulously validated and cleaned each ingredient, step, and flavor, establishing a rock-solid foundation for robust insights.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Delve into the heart of culinary data as I decipher hidden patterns and trends. I utilized advanced correlation analysis and feature importance techniques, shedding light on valuable insights that form the recipe landscape.

## Model Development & Evaluation
Armed with a Python-powered arsenal of classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, I engineered and fine-tuned models aimed at predicting high-traffic recipes. Leveraging the strength of Data Augmentation within these classifiers, I ensured enhanced performance and robustness, all driven by data-driven precision.

## Rethinking Performance Metrics
Introducing the groundbreaking concept of **Adjusted High Traffic Recipe Prediction Accuracy**‚Äîa metric designed to measure real-world impact. I compared each model's accuracy against a baseline of 0.75, offering a relative performance benchmark. The magic unfolds in the adjusted accuracy‚Äîcalculated by subtracting the baseline accuracy from each model's performance. This provides valuable insights into how each model excels or falls short in comparison, showcasing the unique characteristics of each approach.

## The Quest for Excellence
While the models reached impressive heights, none quite hit the ultimate threshold. However, a glimmer of hope emerged from the SVM classifier trained with SMOTE, promising a tantalizing glimpse of what's achievable.

## Fusing Data and Innovation
This journey merges the art of culinary creativity with the precision of data science, forging a brighter path for heightened user engagement and satisfaction.
